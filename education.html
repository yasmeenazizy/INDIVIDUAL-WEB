	<p>I started going to Kindergarten at the age of 4 years old until 6 years old.
	<br>I remembered when my mother told me I was going to Kindergarten, I was very excited.
	<br>I was excited to learn about numbers, shapes, math and words.
	<br>My mother enrolled me in a Chinese Kindergarten School in Penang because she wants me 
	<br>to learn other languages besides English and Malay. Also, it was easier for my parents, 
	<br>since they worked near my Kindergarten.
	<br>I remembered my first Mandarin teacher, she taught me everything and I was always successful
	<br>in her class. I learned on how to count to ten in Mandarin and later will be awarded with stickers and candy.</p></center>

		<p>My old primary school was Sekolah Kebangsaan Seri Permai, Penang. I went
		<br>there for 3 months only before my family decided to move to Bukit Mertajam.
		<br>My new primary school is Sekolah Kebangsaan Jalan Baharu, Bukit Mertajam and it
		<br>was located near my grandmother house, so everytime after school
		<br>I would go back to my grandmother's house instead of living with my parents because of work.
		<br>Being an introvert, I still remember how it was hard for me to find new friends since everyone 
		<br>has already had their own clique. But one day, a girl named Husna approach me and we instantly becoming best friend.
		<br>Being friends with Husna made me becoming a new person. I was no longer alone and shy,
		<br>I became more active with academic and curricular activities. Me and Husna decided to joined
		<br>the Netball team and we will always practicing after school. Unfortunately, Husna moved to
		<br>Kulim on Standard 5, so I was left alone again until I finish my UPSR examination. Luckily,
		<br>I was able to get 4A's for my UPSR in Bahasa Melayu, English, Science and Mathematics.</p></center>

			<h1>High School</h1>
			<h2>(2012-2016)</h2>
			<img src="images/education-4.jpg" alt="Primary" style="width:400px;height:600; border-radius: 10px;">	

			<p>After receiving my UPSR results, I decided to not going to any boarding school,
			<br>instead going to a normal high school near my house. I went to Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan
			<br>Permai Indah. I took a bus every morning to school. I met a lot of good friends, too. 
			<br>Most people said that high school is the best years of your life and I agreed with it. 
			<br>I learned so much about myself and so much about life. I learned what the words family, love,
			<br>betrayal, law and life meant. My personality hasn't changed, I'm still the introvert girl. 
			<br>But I'm always thankful to have a group of friends who always being tolerant and always comforting
			<br>me.</p></center>

			<img src="images/education-3.jpg" alt="Primary" style="width:300px;height:600; border-radius: 10px;">		
		
			<p>These are my high school's bestfriends. Some of them have already working somewhere 
			<br>and some were still studying like me. When i think about my high school memories,
			<br>there are many things that come to mind. Most of the good memories involved my good friends and most of the bad memories involved just me. 
			<br>Some examples of good memories in high school is just like going to the different sports games with my friends.
			<br>My friends and I attended many of the school football games, rugby games and some netball games. 
			<br>Since junior year, I was a shy, unmotivated young girl that didn't really know what she was getting into. 
			<br>I am leaving high school like a girl who is mature, outgoing, and very sure of herself. 
			<br>If high school has taught me anything it is that you should always have confidence in yourself. 
			<br>If you believe in yourself and you believe that you can achieve anything you want in life, good things will happen to you.
			<br>Knowing that I am graduating high school and never coming back hasn't really hit me yet. 
			<br>Those 5 years has been an overall life changing experience that I will never forget.</p></center>

	<center>
		<p>My parents had always told me that it is extremely important to receive a diploma 
		<br>not only because of acquisition of new knowledge but also because of the different experiences.
		<br>After finishing my SPM, I applied for UiTM Diploma in Office Management and got accepted at 
		<br>UiTM Merbok, Kedah. My experience so far at UiTM Kedah has been a roller coaster ride.
		<br>It has had its ups and downs similar to any other new experience to a person. My Diploma experiences 
		<br>thus far have been amazing, despite the hard things and a very hectic life. Also, it has been 
		<br>a few months since I last finished my Diploma and waiting to graduate with a cgpa 3.70.</P></center>

	<center>
		<img src="images/education-6.jpg" alt="Primary" style="width:300px;height:600; border-radius: 10px;">		
		
		<p>I have learned and experienced so many new things in such a short period of time, and it has gone by so fast. 
		<br>I am still discovering all the opportunities that university offers me. 
		<br>UiTM Kedah is a very welcoming place, and from the first day, I felt at home there. 
		<br>I have made many new friends from many different backgrounds. There are from Kedah, Perlis and 
        <br>many more and that has allowed me an insight into their cultures.</p></center>

			<p>After finishing my Diploma, I applied for Penerapan Sarjana Muda in Office System Management
			<br>and I got accepted to continued my Degree at UiTM Machang, Kelantan. As a freshman it takes some time
			<br>for me adjusting to get used to the style of learning especially since this pandemic, we have to use the 
			<br>platform of online learning. But luckily, two of my friends during my Diploma year was there with me,
			<br>and coincidentally they're were my classmates so it lessen some of the burden I was facing. 
			<br>It has been a few months since I started my bachelor's degree, and in just another few months, we're 
			<br>going to end our second semester. It is definitely has been an experience I will need in the future 
			<br>and it is better to learn it now than later on down the road.</p></center>

		<center>
			<img src="images/education-8.jpg" alt="Primary" style="width:300px;height:600; border-radius: 10px;">		
				
			<p>These are my classmate during my Diploma year who actually were once again my classmate during
			<br>my Degree year. However, due to the pandemic season all the university were closed and students were asked 
			<br>to have an online classes instead. My online learning experience as a student is not so good.
			<br>I have to wake up early every day and I'm not a morning person. In addition, online classes is confusing when 
			<br>the lecturer gives us work mostly since it's easier for me to do work with instructions that the lecturer gives.
			<br>Being in a physical classroom makes me only focus on my work, but online learning makes it harder to focus 
			<br>because I have to also focus on household stuff, and it throws me off.
			<br>I would not want to do online learning in the future because it is hard for me to concentrate on my work only.
			<br>Nevertheless, UiTM is a place that truly helps shaping one's personality.
			<br>It is like another Godsend gift for me. It is one of the best universities in my entire vicinity. 
			<br>We are truly cared, rightly educated and well socialized here. I myself feel proud of being a student here. 
			<br>I do take care of what is being taught and what is to learn. I respect my lecturers, my fellow beings,
			<br>my university and everything that is associated with it.</P></center>
