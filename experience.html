<h2>My Working Experiences</h2>
<P>I finished my SPM in 2016 and I remember the joy of sitting at home thinking about never having homework again! 
<br>While waiting for my SPM results to release, I tried to be productive
<br>by looking for a part-time job to earn some extra cash for the time being.
<br>I got hired at a bakery near my house area and with no experience I learned quickly
<br>that it would be hard. Working in a bakery might be joyful but it was also tough.
<br>The bakery opens well before the morning rush and the employees start baking even before that.
<br>At 17, I was working six days a week, tired and unimpressed with my career.</P></center>

<P>Every morning, I would pack orders for the day, put fresh bread out
<br>and make sure the display cases were all stocked and clean.
<br>Like any other job, it has its ups and downs. I was working 8 hours days
<br>even during weekends. I barely had enough time to hang out with friends, or even watch TV.
<br>Everytime after work, my back and knees hurts so bad so I will immediately washed up and go 
<br>to sleep. It was tiring, but despite it all, it was satisfying. I also learned on how to multitask
<br>by remembering the recipes. With that skills, I used it to bake cake for my family sometimes.
<br>When I first received my first official pay-check and although it was not that much, 
<br>I also learned on how to be professional working with a team of people, some of whom I consider good friends to this day.</p></center>

<P>After 5 months working at the bakery, I decided to resigned and looked out for other part-time job.
<br>I got hired at a Cotton On, Aeon Mall Bukit Mertajam as a Sales Assistant. 
<br>My daily job is to greet customers who enter the shop, always responsible for ensuring that customers 
<br>have an enjoyable shopping experience and spends lots of cash so the business can keep going. 
<br>Also, in total charge of unpacking clothes, hanging them and then security tagging them.
<br>Honestly, I can say that I loved working here compare to the bakery because it is less tiring
<br>and I got a day off per week. As a part-timer, I can say that it is a great job for me to earn
<br>some extra money and also I was able to get a fun team although we have to handle some difficult customers.
<br>However, we have good communication, cooperation and teamwork to increase the store's sale. 
<br>Besides, I also learned a lot of skills on how to manage the store and customers.
<br>I'll always remember my bakery time as tough, hard work, but it's also a full, lived experience for me.</P></center>

<P>In 2018, for my community engagement project I decided to joined my father to do the volunteering work at
<br>Pattani, Thailand. I didn't know much about them or what I did when I first joined them. When I was volunteering,
<br>part of what I did was get the donations from people and sort them into the proper places.
<br>It was important for me to see and feel how people in other cultures lives. I always
<br>find it amazing how friendly and helpful most poor people are. While doing this project,
<br>I learned a lot about the Thai's community. First of all, even though I knew that Pattani was an
<br>area that had an issue with poverty, I didn't realize how bad it was in places.
<br>This charity project also showed me that when a community works together they can have great results.
<br>After that, I decided to continue doing a lot of community service. I have done some
<br>charity project during my Diploma year with my friends to help the strays cats and
<br>also donating some food supplies and clothes to the orphans. This community project made
<br>me leave my comfort zone a bit. I had a lot of fun volunteering with young children and animals. 
<br>Overall, it was an amazing experiences for me and I feel like my time was well spent. I also feel that
<br>without these experiences, I may missed out on something huge.</P></center>
